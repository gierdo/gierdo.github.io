## Linux on the HP Elitebook 1030 G1

This page is about my linux setup on the HP Elitebook 1030 G1.

I am running KDE NEON (basically Ubuntu 16.04 with a ppa for everything cute)
on a 1030 with m7, 16GB of ram and the touchscreen configuration, whatever the
exact model code may be.

### The Good

Everything I care about runs great, battery life is better than at my friend's
exact same 1030 G1 running the stock Windows 10.  The only things I haven't
checked, as I don't care about it, are the fingerprint reader, NFC and the
built-in trusted computing module thingy.

### The Bad

Some fn keys do not work due to an acpi bug in the bios:

 - fn + f9, Brightness down (brightness up works fine)
 - fn + f8, Microphone off/on

I solved the issue by mapping the functionality to windows + the corresponding
f-key

### The Ugly

Nothing, really. I'm very happy with the device itself and the whole setup.
