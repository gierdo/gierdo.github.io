## Welcome to my GitHub Page

This GitHub Page collects bits and pieces that are of interest to me, my
computer's setup and / or other people.

The blog entry that made me start this page is about [Linux on the HP Elitebook 1030 G1](blog/2017/11/21/linux_on_1030), which might be of interest to you, if you want to run a similar setup.
